Every morning, I run in the park to start my day with energy. It makes me happy and ready for any challenges. The park is big, and there's plenty of space for everyone. I feel smart when I think about my plans for the day during my run, even though the morning is cold.

The previous generation, like my grandparents, were old and wise. They always told me not to get angry over small things and to just eat healthy food and drink plenty of water. When I feel sad, I remember their advice, and it helps me feel better.

My friend is always quick, he doesn't tolerate slowness. He is also robust like an athlete. His family is affluent, but he never boasts about it, unlike some needy people who crave wealth.
