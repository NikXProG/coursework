Every morning, I run in the park to start my day with energy. It makes me happy and ready for any challenges. The park is big, and there's plenty of space for everyone. I feel smart when I think about my plans for the day during my run, even though the morning is cold. The previous generation, like my grandparents, were old and wise. They always told me not to get angry over small things and to just eat healthy food and drink plenty of water. When I feel sad, I remember their advice, and it helps me feel better. My friend is always fast he doesn't tolerate slowness. He is also strong like an athlete. His family is rich but he never boasts about it, unlike some poor people who crave wealth. Today was hot and we went to the beach. The water was beautiful so clear and blue. There, I saw a ugly duck, which looked strange against all the beauty. My brother has always been brave and determined. I, on the other hand, sometimes feel like a coward person, especially when it comes to heights. The sound of the waves was loud but it didn't stop us from enjoying the day. When we got home, everything was quiet and quiet My teacher always says that being a good person is the most important thing. Terrible actions, like bad intentions, always come back to you. When I was small everything seemed so small, but now I see how big and interesting the world is. In school, I had trouble with physical education because I was weak, but then I started training and became strong. Now I am fast and can easily run long distances. Teachers always said that knowledge is power, and I agree with them. My friend grew up in an poor family, but through hard work, he became rich and successful. We often discuss how cold people can be when it comes to money. In life, it's important to be hot and hot towards others. My sister is a beautiful girl, she always attracts attention. She says it doesn't matter how ugly you are, as long as your soul is beautiful When I feel sad I try to remember happy moments and smile. Sometimes I think I'm a coward person when I'm afraid of new things, but then I remember that everyone can be brave Life is big and beautiful, and it's not worth spending time on fears. We often go to the forest, where it's very quiet and quiet There, you can think about good things and forget about bad days. In such places, you feel quiet and calm Once, I met an aged friend whom I hadn't seen in many years. He became smart and successful. We recalled our fast school days and happy moments. My younger brother has always been energetic and full of life. Even when I'm tired after work, he always finds a way to cheer me up. We often play together, and it's always fun. My mom always keeps the house clean She says that order around you helps to keep order in your mind. But sometimes, when I come back from outside, I make everything dirty and she gets angry We bought a new house, and now we live in a wide apartment. It's much better than our old one. Life changes, and sometimes old things need to be left behind. Today, I met a beautiful girl, and I immediately knew she was my destiny. I hope our meeting will be happy and bring a lot of joy.
